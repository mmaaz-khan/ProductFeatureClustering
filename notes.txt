NOTES ON K-MEANS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- There are 2 main methods of implementing K-Means:
    1) Measuring within-cluster variance for every possible cluster where K cluster are needed
       and there are n datapoints
    2) Selecting cluster centers and assigning data points to the cluster with closest cluster
       center and recalculate centers and repeat

Method 1) proves to be very computationally intensive as K and n increase:
- There are K^n possibilities so eg for K=2 and n=20, there are 1048575 clsuter assignments
- This exponential increase makes it infeasable for larger datasets or when we need a high
  number of clusters

Method 2) is used more in implementation. It steps are as follows:
1) In iteration t=0, select K data points to be initial cluster centers
    - We need to ensure we choose these centers sensibly otherwise we can face problems later
      on and get stuck in a local minima when finding our solution
    - We can do this in 2 ways (and even combine them):
        a) Randomly select the centers and run the algorithm several times and select the best
           centers
        b) Be smart with how we pick centers (eg don't pick points that are too close to one
           another)
2) In each iteration, assign each data point to the cluster with closest cluster center in the
   previous iteration
    - We break ties by assigning the point to the cluster with lower index. Eg if we have 3
      clusters K1, K2, K3, and our point p is equidistant to all of their centers, then we assign
      it to K1 as 1<2<3 so K1 has the lowest index
3) Recalulcate the cluster centers of each cluster
    - This is done by just calculating the average of each points x and y co-ordinates
4) If cluster centers have changed, repeat from step 2), else terminate and return final clusters

NOTES ON DATA HANDLING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- When selecting features for the dataset to be used, I do not need to keep fields which are human
  labels
    - This is because they provide no real benefit to the clustering selection
- Instead empirical features should be selected as this is what will impact the clusters
